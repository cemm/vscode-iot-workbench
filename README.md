[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench)

The **Azure IoT Device Workbench** is an extension in Visual Studio Code that provides an integrated environment to code, build, deploy and debug your IoT device project with multiple Azure services supported. And it also supports working with [IoT Plug and Play](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-pnp/overview-iot-plug-and-play) by defining *device capability model* schema and generating skeleton device code and project based on it.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

For developing on Embedded Linux device, you will need Docker and Visual Studio Code version with [Visual Studio Code Remote Development](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote) to compile the device code in the [containerized device toolchain](https://aka.ms/iot-device-cube).

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with version >= 1.36.1.
- [Docker Desktop / CE](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

### Install extensions

1. Launch VS Code, in the Extension tab, find and install **"Azure IoT Device Workbench"**.
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench/master/docs/images/device-workbench.png" />

2. Reload the window and make sure all the dependency extensions are correctly installed:

   - Azure Account
   - Azure IoT Hub Toolkit
   - C/C++
   - IoT Device Cube
   - Remote Development

### Install Docker

If you are developing on Embedded Linux for [ARM Cortex-A series](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-a) devices, you need to install and configure Docker in order to use container as compiling environment. And [VS Code Remote](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote) is the technology that enables this experience.You can skip this step if you are developing for Arduino or ESP32 devices.

- Install Docker Desktop for Windows

  Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) and make sure to enable driver sharing for Docker to access your local folder:

  1. Right click the **Docker** icon in the task try and select "Settings".
  2. Click on the "Shared Drivers" section and choose the driver to be shared.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench/master/docs/images/shared-drivers.png" />

- Install Docker Desktop for Mac

  Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) and make sure to enable driver sharing for Docker to access your local folder, which is enabled by default.

- Get Docker for Linux

  Linux is a highly variable environment and the large number of server, container, and desktop distributions can make it difficult to know what is supported. Please check this [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/linux) for Linux support.

## Develop device using IoT Plug and Play

The Azure IoT Device Workbench Visual Studio Code extension provides an integrated environment to author IoT Plug and Play *device capability models (DCM)* and *interfaces*, publish to model repositories, and generate skeleton C code to implement the device application.

## Develop generic device

Azure IoT Device Workbench aims to support multiple device platforms and its devices. Currently the following device platforms and languages are supported.

Please take the [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/C7NY7KJ) to let us know extra device platforms and languages you want to see support in Device Workbench.

### Embedded Linux <sup>public preview</sup>

To simplify the cross compiling tool chain, Azure IoT Device SDK and dependencies setup and configuration, Device Workbench put all these components in the container. All cross-compiling works happen in it. Here is the quick start of using it to develop and compile a simple device app written in C and running on [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) to send telemetry data to Azure IoT Hub.

Languages supported: `C/C++`

Devices supported: [Cortex-A series](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-a) devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi, NXP i.MX6) that are running Embedded Linux such as Debian, Ubuntu or Yocto Linux.

#### Create new project

1. Within VS Code, press `F1` to open the command palette, then type and select **Azure IoT Device Workbench: Create Project...**.

2. Enter the name of your project.

3. Select **Embedded Linux** from device platform list.

4. Select the dev container based on your target device, in this sample, select **32-bit Armv7 Cortex-A** for Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ running [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).

5. For the first time, it takes around 1 to 3 minutes depending on your Internet speed to download and prepare the dev container. You can click the **details** link on the notification for the progress:
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench/master/docs/images/prepare-dev-container.png" />

6. Once the dev container is ready, you can see the status in the status bar and output window.
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench/master/docs/images/dev-container-ready.png" />

#### Compile the code

1. The `iothub_sample.c` under the `src` subfolder is the source file contains the logic. You can modify or add your own code in it.
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench/master/docs/images/iothub-sample.png" />

2. To compile the code, press `F1`, type and select **Azure IoT Device Workbench: Compile Device Code** from the command palette.

3. The cross-compiling of the code happens in the dev container. Once it's done, it pops up the notification.
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench/master/docs/images/compile-success.png" />

4. The compiled binary file is located in `.build` folder.

#### Upload to target device

1. Before upload the executable binary file to the target device, please make sure:

   - The running OS on the device is correct (e.g. Raspbian running on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+).
   - The SSH is enabled on the device. Follw this [instructions](https://itsfoss.com/ssh-into-raspberry/) to do so.
   - Get the IP address of the device so that you can deploy the compiled binary to the device via SSH.

2. In VS Code, press `F1`, type and select **Azure IoT Device Workbench: Upload Device Code** from the command palette, then select **Manual setup** and enter IP address, port, user name and password to deploy the compiled binary via SSH to Raspberry Pi.

   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench/master/docs/images/upload-options.png" width=540 />

#### Verify the result

1. To start running the deployed binary, SSH into your Raspberry Pi device. You can follow this [instruction](https://itsfoss.com/ssh-into-raspberry/) to do so.

2. You need to copy the device connection as the parameter to run the app, follow [this guide](./docs/create-iothub-device.md) to use Azure IoT Hub Toolkit to do so.

3. Run the `azure_iot_app [connection string]` and you will see the Raspberry Pi start sending telemetry data to the Azure IoT Hub.
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench/master/docs/images/result.png" />

4. To verify the reception of the data, use Azure IoT Hub Toolkit, right click on the device and select **Start Monitoring Built-in Event Endpoint**. In the output window, you can see that IoT Hub gets telemetry data sent from Raspberry Pi.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench/master/docs/images/provision.gif" />

#### Note: 
-  When invoking the **Azure IoT Device Workbench: Provision Azure Services...** command with Azure IoT Hub and Azure Functions, by default, Azure Functions would use the IoT Hub consumer group of `$Default`. To switch to another consumer group, please follow the [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal) to create a new consumer group in Azure Portal. Then in IoT project, modify the following setting in **function.json**:
    ```
    "consumerGroup": "[consumer_group_name]"
    ```
-  You may open an existing IoT project after you close it. To do so:
    -  In the menu of **Visual Studio Code**, choose *File -> Open Workspace...* .
    -  In file selection panel, navigate to the folder that contains your project and select *{PROJECT_NAME}.code-project*.
