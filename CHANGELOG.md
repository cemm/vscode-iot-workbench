## Version 0.10.10

- Release date: August 4, 2019

### Added

Something great is going to happen, coming soon :)

## Version 0.3.1

- Release date: July 9, 2019

### Added

- We are excited to announce the preview of a new feature enabled in Azure IoT Device Workbench extension in VS Code to simplify the device cross-compiling toolchain acquisition effort for device developers working on embedded Linux devices (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, Yocto Linuxâ€¦) with Azure IoT by encapsulating the compilers, [device SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) and essential libraries in [Containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container). All you need is to install or upgrade the IoT Device Workbench and [get started](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench#embedded-linux-public-preview) developing within the container, just like today you are using a local environment.

### Fixed

- Fix the issue of "MXCHIP AZ3166 serial port button not work" [#661](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench/issues/661) which started after update to VS Code 1.36.0.

Special thanks to [br1pro](https://github.com/br1pro) and [Remco Ploeg](https://github.com/rploeg), thanks for your feedbacks.
